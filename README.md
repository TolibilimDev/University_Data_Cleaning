# University_Data_Cleaning
This project focuses on analyzing students' exam data, including their names, age, gender, admission test scores, high school percentages, and final admission status. The primary goal is to clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency for meaningful insights.
  Key Data Features:
Names: The students' names for identification purposes.
Age: The age of the students, which can influence their admission decision or category.
Gender: The gender of each student, which might be useful for analyzing gender distribution in admissions.
Admission Test Score: The score obtained by students in the admission test, which can be a crucial factor in determining their eligibility for admission.
High School Percentage: The percentage score from the student’s high school academic records, which is another factor in the admission decision process.
Admission Status: The final status of each student—whether they were Accepted or Rejected based on their scores and other factors.

The main objective of this project is to clean the data so that it can be used for further analysis. This includes:

Handling missing or incorrect data: Some entries in the dataset might be missing or incorrect (e.g., missing scores or inaccurate age information). These need to be identified and addressed.
Data transformation: Some columns may need to be transformed for analysis (e.g., normalizing admission test scores or categorizing age groups).
Data consistency: Ensuring that all data entries are consistent and correctly formatted (e.g., making sure that gender is correctly recorded as "Male" or "Female" and not as "M" or "F" inconsistently).
